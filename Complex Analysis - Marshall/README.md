# Complex Analysis
This is a rare entry of the repository, as these notes were actually developed to help me with a specific course.

In the spring of 2024, the course [SF2745 Advanced Complex Analysis](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/SF2745?l=en) at KTH was examined through an oral exam. For the oral exam, every one of these definitions and theorems could be tested, including the proofs of select theorems.

The course followed Donald Marshall's *Complex Analysis* (ISBN 978-1-107-13482-9). Unlike my earlier exposure to complex analysis, this book follows Weierstra√ü's approach, starting with power expansions and analytic functions. This makes for an interesting change for those who previously have started with holomorphic functions and ended with analytic functions.
