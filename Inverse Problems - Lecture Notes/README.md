# Complex Analysis
This is a rare entry of the repository, as these notes were actually developed to help me with a specific course.

In the autumn of 2025, I took the course [SF2529 Inverse Problems](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/SF2529?l=en) at KTH. These are the notes I took from the lectures.

The notes are not complete, and you will find notes throughout the document (usually in red), indicating things that should be added, and/or followed up on. If you are taking the course and know what is missing, please feel free to make a pull-request with your addition. Alternatively, email me at bjurstam@kth.se with your suggested addition.
