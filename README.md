# Mathematics Notes Collection

This repository contains my personal notes from various mathematics courses and textbooks. The notes are organized by subject and author, and are written in LaTeX for clarity and structure. They mainly include definitions and in some cases theorems. The notes, particularly for definitions are intended to be used for quick references while either reading or proving theorems from the books, or when doing exercises. I found it helpful to reduce time spent searching in the books.

In general these notes are not tied to any university course, but only to my self-studying. As such the chapters chosen are what interested me at the time, and do not necessarily follow a natural progression of the material, the notes might also be incomplete.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders by textbook.

- `Definitions.tex` – Contains definitions, both those given as stated as a numbered definition and those only given in the text.
- `Theorems.tex` – (Where applicable) Statements of key theorems, sometimes with indications of which proofs are required.
- PDF exports of the above for easy reading.

## Books and Subjects Covered
I have ordered the books by "completeness" of the notes.

- **Measure Theory** (Donald L.Cohn)
- **Complex Analysis** (Donald Marshall)
- **Functional Analysis, Sobolev Spaces, and PDE** (Haim Brezis) \*
- **Advanced Linear Algebra** (Steven Roman) \*\*
- **Inverse Problems** (Lecture notes for the course SF2529) \*

\* Under active development, I have just started.  
\*\* Currently not in active development as I have focused on other things instead.

## Usage

You are welcome to browse or use these notes for your own studies. All `.tex` files can be compiled with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) to produce PDFs. The repository includes `.gitignore` rules to avoid committing LaTeX build artifacts.

## Disclaimer

These notes are for personal use and may contain errors or omissions. They are not a substitute for the original textbooks or lectures.
